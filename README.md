# Decentralized Lottery App

# Problem
There are many lottery and beting websites that tell to their users that 
the winners are chosen completely randomly.These websites are completely
centerelized and sometimes manipulate the winners for their profit. Due
to the lack of transparency, most of the times players don't know they scammed.

# soulution
we can build a decenterelized lottery app that every data store in the blockchain.
with the power of blockchain we can have transparency and every user can trust to 
this lottery app. project is opensource and can be audit by Certik , SigmaPrime and ...

# Workflow

# Phase 1:
1- when the lottery is open every User can deposit 0.1 ETH to the contract 
to be eligible for participating in this lottery.

2- when the lottery is close the winner will randomly select and all  the 
contract's Ether will transfer to the winner.

3- in phase1 only admin can close the lottery and every address just can have
1 ticket (deposit only 0.1 ETH).

# phase 2:
1- I will use ChainLink VRF to have truly random number

2- Winner in addition to all contract's Ethereum will eligible to mint a rare NFT ( or this NFT will send to winner ).

# phase 3:
1- remove lottery ticket limits (in the past user must send just 0.1 eth) so send more eth to have more winning chance.

2- users will earn staking rewards when deposit ether to contract in lottery period (staking rewards don't send to winner). 

3- build a DAO and give more access to users.

# Future Idea
In the future this project may be a platform for distribute Rare NFTs. Users can send Ether to contract and when lottery close, all the ETH transfer to the NFT artist and the
winner of the lottery will get a rare NFT
